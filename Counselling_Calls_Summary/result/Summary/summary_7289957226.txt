The purpose of the call was to address the patient's skin issue and provide information about the treatment process. The patient expressed concerns about pigmentation and uneven skin tone after a previous laser treatment. I explained the initial steps of our Ayurvedic approach, including pulse diagnosis and identifying imbalances in the body, which could be contributing to the skin condition. I also detailed the treatment options available, including customized facials and lifestyle modifications. The patient inquired about the costs and expressed interest in scheduling an appointment, but no appointment was confirmed during this call. I advised the patient to call back to finalize the appointment and assured them that we would accommodate their schedule.
