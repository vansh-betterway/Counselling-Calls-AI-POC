The purpose of the call was to address the patient's medical concern regarding knee pain and clicking sounds. The patient, Ashok, described his symptoms, including difficulty walking and pain in his left knee. I explained the potential causes of his knee issues, including a meniscus tear and the importance of proper treatment to avoid surgical options. I discussed the treatment process at Betterway, specifically the use of Panchakarma to promote healing and improve blood circulation in the affected area. Although I provided detailed information about the treatment options, no appointment was confirmed during this call, and the patient expressed the need to get an X-ray done first. I advised him to consult with a doctor after obtaining the necessary imaging to determine the best course of action.
