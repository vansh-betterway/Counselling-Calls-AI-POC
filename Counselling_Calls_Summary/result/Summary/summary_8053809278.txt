The purpose of the call was to address Vishal Soni's medical concerns, specifically regarding his shoulder pain and diabetes. Vishal expressed difficulty in lifting his arms and mentioned a history of a cyst in his pancreas. I explained the treatment process, including pulse diagnosis and the various methods we use, such as Panchakarma and lifestyle modifications, to address his frozen shoulder and diabetes. Although I confirmed that his appointment was booked for today at 7 PM, I did not allocate a specific doctor during this call. I advised him to arrive a few minutes early for the necessary formalities. Next, I will send him the location details for the appointment.
