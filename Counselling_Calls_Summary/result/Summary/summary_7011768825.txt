The purpose of the call was to discuss the patient's mother-in-law's knee condition and the possibility of a total knee replacement (TKR). The patient expressed concerns about the necessity of the surgery and inquired about alternative treatments. I explained the process of TKR, the symptoms associated with knee issues, and the potential benefits of Panchakarma therapy as a non-surgical option. I also discussed the importance of an initial consultation to assess the condition and determine the appropriate treatment plan. The patient was informed about the costs associated with consultations and treatments, and I encouraged them to schedule an appointment for a thorough evaluation. The next steps involve the patient confirming a suitable time for the consultation.
