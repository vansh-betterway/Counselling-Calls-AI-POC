The purpose of the call was to address the patient's inquiry regarding Ayurvedic medicines for her husband. The patient expressed concern about the availability of specific medications and wanted to ensure that they could be prescribed by a doctor during the consultation. I explained that the patient would need to consult with a doctor to receive a prescription for the medications. The patient mentioned several specific medicines, but I informed her that some of them would not be available at our facility. I also provided information about the consultation charges and the doctor's availability. The next steps involve the patient booking a prior slot for the appointment to discuss her husband's medication needs further.
