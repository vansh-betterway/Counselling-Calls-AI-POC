The purpose of the call was to assist Archana with her inquiry regarding a consultation for fibroids. Archana expressed concerns about the size of her fibroid and its implications for conception. I explained the consultation process, including the need for an ultrasound and potential treatment options, emphasizing that the doctor would provide a detailed assessment after the examination. I confirmed that an appointment has been booked for her at 3:30 PM today, and I provided information about the consultation fee and follow-up services included in the membership plan. Archana was advised to arrive 10-15 minutes early for her appointment, and I ensured she received a confirmation message on WhatsApp.
