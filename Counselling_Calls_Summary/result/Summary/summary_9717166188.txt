The purpose of the call was to address the patient's inquiry regarding the treatment options for gallbladder stones using Ayurveda. The patient expressed concern about the size of the gallbladder stone, which was detected to be around 11 mm. I explained the Ayurvedic procedure called Virechana, which involves the use of medicated ghee and a cleansing process to help remove impurities from the liver and gallbladder. I also mentioned that the treatment may involve scraping to clear any stones and that the effectiveness of the ultrasound measurements can vary. I informed the patient that they would need to visit for a consultation to determine the best course of action based on pulse diagnosis. The patient was advised that the clinic is open on Sundays and was encouraged to come in for a consultation. However, no appointment was confirmed during this call.
