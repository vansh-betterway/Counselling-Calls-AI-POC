The purpose of the call was to address the patient's inquiry regarding job vacancies for a technician position. The patient expressed that her husband, who is a technician with two years of experience, is currently seeking employment due to a recent situation that required him to be on bed rest. I informed the patient that there are no current vacancies available. I also provided her with the HR contact number for future inquiries. The patient was advised to connect with the HR department the following day. No appointment or consultation was discussed, and no doctor was allocated during this call.
